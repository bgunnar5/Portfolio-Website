      These object-oriented data structures allow the user to create and modify the tree, and also to create pipelines that successively execute different processes regarding time series files. 
      These processes include various preprocessing methods (such as file I/O, data involving pandas DataFrame creation/manipulation, and more), modeling and forecasting, statistics, and visualization. 
      Data scientists can then use this transformation tree design to run different pipelines and see which forecasting model works best."
